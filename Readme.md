# Hotel Booking Assistant

This is a simple hotel booking assistant that helps you find rooms, book them, and register as a user.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Install the required packages by running:
   ```
   pip install python-dotenv langchain requests
   ```

3. Create a file named `.env` in the same folder as the app and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the hotel API server (make sure it's running on http://localhost:5000).

5. Run the main.py file:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

6. The assistant will greet you. You can now ask questions or make requests like:
   - "Show me all available rooms"
   - "I want to book a room"
   - "Can you register me as a new user?"

7. Follow the assistant's prompts and provide information when asked.
